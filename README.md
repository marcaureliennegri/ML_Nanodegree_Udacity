# UDACITY NANODEGREE
## Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch
The ultimate goal of the Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch Nanodegree program is to help students learn machine learning techniques such as data transformation and algorithms that can find patterns in data and apply machine learning algorithms to tasks of their own design.

## Projects:
+ **Finding Donors for CharityML**:
Apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.
+ **Create Your Own Image Classifier**: 
Define and train a neural network in PyTorch that learns to classify images; going from image data exploration to network training and evaluation.
+ **Identify Customer Segments with Arvato**: 
Study a real dataset of customers for a company, and apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to segment customers into similar groups and extract information that may be used for marketing or product improvement.
